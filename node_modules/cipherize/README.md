Using Cipherize for Data Encryption and Decryption
Cipherize is a npm package that provides functionality for encrypting and decrypting data securely. Follow the steps below to integrate Cipherize into your project:

**Installation**
First, install the Cipherize package from npm by running the following command in your project directory:

**install using**
![alt text](./results/image-6.png)

**Usage**
Now you can use the Cipherize functions to encrypt, decrypt, hash, and compare data.

Once installed, initialize Cipherize in your project by requiring it:
![alt text](./results/image-1.png)

**Encrypting Data**
To encrypt data, use the encryptData function:
![alt text](./results/image-2.png)

**Decrypting Data**
To decrypt data, use the decryptData function:
![alt text](./results/image-3.png)

**Hashing Data**
To hash data, use the hashData function:
![alt text](./results/image-4.png)

**Comparing Hashes**
To compare hashed data with a value, use the compareHash function:
![alt text](./results/image-5.png)

**Test output**
![alt text](./results/image.png)

**Note**
Cipherize operates on localhost by default. Ensure that your backend server is running on http://localhost:5000 or adjust the URLs accordingly if your server is hosted elsewhere.

**Endpoints:**

Key: http://localhost:5000/key (GET)
Encrypt: http://localhost:5000/encrypt (POST)
decryptData Function
Similar to encryptData, this function retrieves the decryption key and IV by sending a GET request to the /key endpoint. Then it sends a POST request to the /decrypt endpoint to decrypt the encrypted data using the retrieved key and IV.

**Endpoints:**
Key: http://localhost:5000/key (GET)
Decrypt: http://localhost:5000/decrypt (POST)
compareHash Function
This function compares the provided value with the hashed value by sending a POST request to the /compareHash endpoint.

**Endpoint**: http://localhost:5000/compareHash (POST)
